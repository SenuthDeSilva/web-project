						Music made using electronic devices, would be the simplest explanation for <strong>Electronic
						Music</strong>, yet it only barely touches on why this genre has amassed such a massive
						following over the years. Emerging during the late 1960s, electronic music started to gain
						popularity during the late 1980s, and it's popularity has skyrocketed, and currently it could
						even be considered a global phenomena. The way this genre differentiates from regular music is
						in its use of instruments like synths, drum machines, and most importantly Digital Audio
						Workstations, or
						DAWs for short.
					</p>
					<p>
						Electronic music and its subgenres have had a profound impact on the music industry and has
						been a driving
						force behind many new developments in music production and performance. It has also become a
						significant part of popular culture, influencing various art forms like visual arts,
						fashion, and dance.

						Electronic music encompasses a wide range of subgenres, each with its unique characteristics
						and style. Some of the popular subgenres of electronic music include:
					</p>
					<h3>House</h3>
					<p>
						Known for its repetitive beats, groovy baselines, and soulful vocals, house music originated
						in the early 1980s in Chicago. It has since become one of the most prominent and influential
						genres in electronic dance music (EDM).
					</p>
					<h3>Techno</h3>
					<p>
						With its roots in Detroit, techno features a futuristic and mechanical sound, driven by
						synthesisers and drum machines. It emphasises a continuous rhythm and often incorporates
						elements of industrial and minimal music.
					</p>
					<h3>Trap</h3>
					<p>
						Emerging from hip-hop and electronic influences, trap music is characterised by its
						aggressive beats, heavy bass, and use of hi-hats. It has gained immense popularity in recent
						years.
					</p>
					<h3>Dubstep</h3>
					<p>
						Originating in the UK, dubstep is known for its heavy basslines, syncopated rhythms, and use
						of wobble bass. It gained widespread recognition in the early 2000s.
					</p>
					<h3>Drum and Bass (DnB)</h3>
					<p>
						With fast-paced beats and basslines, DnB is a high-energy genre that originated in the UK.
						It often features rapid breakbeats and sub-bass elements.
					</p>
					<h3>Future Bass</h3>
					<p>
						Characterized by its melodic and uplifting sound, future bass incorporates elements from
						various genres, including trap and dubstep, to create a unique and emotive musical
						experience.
					</p>
					<h3>Lo-fi</h3>
					<p>
						Lo-fi, short for "low-fidelity", is a genre known for its raw and unpolished sound. It often
						includes sampled beats and nostalgic elements, creating a cosy and laid-back atmosphere.
					</p>
					<h3>Ambient</h3>
					<p>
						Ambient music focuses on creating a tranquil and atmospheric experience through
						synthesisers, textures, and subtle melodies. It is often used for relaxation and meditation.
					</p>
					<h3>Experimental</h3>
					<p>
						As the name suggests, experimental electronic music pushes the boundaries of traditional
						music, incorporating unconventional sounds, structures, and techniques to create unique
						sonic experiences.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each subgenre offers a distinct journey for listeners, and electronic music as a whole
						continues to evolve and inspire new generations of artists and music enthusiasts.
